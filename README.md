# Module02 Lab - Use types in TypeScript
Exercise 1: Modify existing JavaScript code to have strongly typed variables

Open the file module02.ts and locate Exercise 1.

Modify the code to add types to the variable declarations. The compiled JavaScript code should look the same as the original example when you're done.


Exercise 2: Modify existing JavaScript code that ensures operational outcomes using strongly typed variables
Locate Exercise 2 in module02.ts.

You can use types to ensure operation outcomes. Run the code as is and then modify it to have strongly typed variables.

Address any errors you find so that the result returned to a is 12.

Exercise 3: Implement an enum type
Locate Exercise 3 in module02.ts.

Implement an enum type called Season that represents the constants "Fall", "Winter", "Spring", and "Summer".

Update the function so you can pass in the season by referencing an item in the enum, for example Season.Fall, instead of the literal string "Fall".

Exercise 4: Declare an array type
Locate Exercise 4 in module02.ts.

Declare the array as the type to match the type of the items in the array.
